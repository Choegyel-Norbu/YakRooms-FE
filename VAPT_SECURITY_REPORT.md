- **Severity**: High  
- **CVE**: GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9
- **Description**: SheetJS contains ReDoS vulnerabilities in regex patterns
- **Impact**: Application freeze/crash through malicious input
- **Location**: `node_modules/xlsx`
- **Recommendation**: Same as above - replace or validate inputs strictly

### 3. **HIGH: Axios DoS Vulnerability**
- **Severity**: High
- **CVE**: CVE-2025-58754
- **Description**: Axios v1.10.0 vulnerable to DoS through data: URI scheme
- **Impact**: Memory exhaustion and application crash
- **Location**: `node_modules/axios`
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Update to axios v1.12.0 or later
  - Implement input validation for URLs
  - Add request size limits

### 4. **HIGH: Form-data Unsafe Random Function**
- **Severity**: Critical
- **CVE**: GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4
- **Description**: form-data v4.0.0-4.0.3 uses unsafe random function for boundary generation
- **Impact**: Potential cryptographic weakness
- **Location**: `node_modules/form-data`
- **Recommendation**: Update form-data to latest version

### 5. **MEDIUM: Vite File Serving Vulnerabilities**
- **Severity**: Medium

## Security Configuration Analysis

### ✅ **Strengths Identified**

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Properly configured CSP headers in `index.html`
   - Restricts script sources and prevents XSS
   - Includes `object-src 'none'` for additional protection

2. **Authentication Architecture**
   - Uses HTTP-only cookies for authentication
   - Implements proper token refresh mechanism
   - Cross-tab synchronization for auth state

3. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive validation for Bhutanese phone numbers
   - CID number validation with proper format checking
   - Date validation with business logic constraints

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Proper separation of development/production URLs
   - Environment variables properly excluded from git
   - Dynamic API URL selection based on context

### ⚠️ **Security Concerns**

1. **API Key Exposure**
   - UploadThing API key stored in environment variables
   - Risk: If exposed, could lead to unauthorized file uploads
   - Recommendation: Implement server-side proxy for file uploads

2. **Console Logging**
   - Multiple console.log statements in production code
   - Risk: Information disclosure in browser console
   - Recommendation: Remove or conditionally disable in production

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - Development server allows multiple ngrok domains
   - Risk: Potential for malicious domain exploitation
   - Recommendation: Restrict allowed hosts in production

## Code Security Analysis

### **Authentication & Authorization**

**Strengths:**
- Role-based access control implemented
- Proper session management with automatic refresh
- Cross-platform authentication compatibility

**Issues:**
- Some routes lack proper protection (e.g., `/addListing`)
- Token storage in localStorage (though mitigated by HTTP-only cookies)

### **Input Validation**

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive phone number validation
- CID number format validation
- Date range validation
- File type validation for uploads

**Issues:**
- Some regex patterns could be optimized for performance
- Missing validation for some user inputs

### **Data Handling**

**Strengths:**
- Proper error handling in most components
- Input sanitization for display
- Secure file upload implementation

**Issues:**
- Some error messages might leak sensitive information
- Potential for timing attacks in authentication flows

---

## Network Security Analysis

### **HTTPS Configuration**
- ✅ Production URLs use HTTPS
- ✅ Proper SSL/TLS configuration
- ⚠️ Development uses HTTP (acceptable for local development)

### **API Security**
- ✅ Proper timeout configuration (10 seconds)
- ✅ Content-Type headers properly set
- ✅ Credentials handling with cookies
- ⚠️ No rate limiting visible on frontend

---

## PWA Security Analysis

### **Service Worker Security**
- ✅ Proper service worker implementation
- ✅ Cache strategies configured
